# Simple-Python-Malware

This a very simple .py file that starts with an initial sanbox recognition. If we understand that we are on sanbox we delete our selves. If we understand that we are not in a sandbox, we take a screenshot of the computer , through a URL we donwload our shellcode place it in memory and run it, we send back to our control server the screenshot that we captured before, delete the .bmp from the disk and last but least call a powershell rev shell.
